# Release 4.4.0

## Enhancements

- The DocString value will receive example values if the DocString is included in the [Scenario Outline](/docs/scenario-outline.md). The issue can be found [here](https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick/issues/145).

## Backward Compatibility

This version is backward compatible unless your DocString contains a substring that looks like an example placeholder (e.g., `<a>,` if "a" is one of the example table columns).
If you fall into this rare category, please change the DocString value slightly so that it does not appear to require example values.
