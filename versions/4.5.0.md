# Release 4.5.0

## Enhancements
- Scenario Outline placeholder name pattern was adjusted to allow steps with angle brackets that may not be placeholders.
The issue can be found [here](https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick/issues/149). Additional documentation can be found [here](/docs/scenario-outline.md).

## Backward Compatibility

This release is backward compatible unless your placeholder names don't match the expected placeholder name pattern. Specifically, the newly imposed pattern starts with an alphanumeric character, followed by anything you want (except the angle brackets), and ends with an alphanumeric character. Starting and ending spaces are no longer allowed.
If your tests start failing after you upgraded to this new version from the previous one, it must suffice if you fix the placeholder names where it does not recognize them.
For more information about placeholders, visit the [Scenario Outline](/docs/scenario-outline.md) documentation.
