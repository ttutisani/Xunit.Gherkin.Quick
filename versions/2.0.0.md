## About Backwards Compatibility

This release is backwards compatible, except for changes in error messages.

Besides, the codebase has gone through major refactoring, and there may be some edge cases where backwards compatibility is not maintained.

I don't expect that there will be a need to modify the consumer code in any significant way (if any at all) to achieve the compatibility with this new version.
